## Context
Releasing new versions of an OpenAPI document can cause issues for consumers. The [semantic versioning specification](https://semver.org/) outlines rules which are designed to make it clear to consumers if a new version contains a breaking change.

## Decision
Add a rule that the OpenAPI document version should use semantic versioning.
